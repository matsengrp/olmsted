# Breaking Updates Progress - Issue #201

**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Status:** Testing breaking package updates systematically  
**Goal:** Fix additional vulnerabilities with controlled breaking changes

---

## Current State of package.json

### ✅ Successfully Applied:
1. **papaparse**: `^4.6.3` → `^5.5.3` ✅
   - Fixed ReDoS vulnerability
   - No breaking changes observed
   - Vulnerabilities: 105 (reduced from baseline)

2. **d3-color**: `^1.4.1` → `^3.1.0` ✅
   - Fixed ReDoS vulnerability
   - Visualizations still working correctly
   - Vulnerabilities: 105 (same as papaparse)

### ❌ Failed:
3. **css-loader**: `^3.6.0` → `^7.1.2` ❌ (retry with webpack 5)
   - First attempt: `this.getOptions is not a function` (webpack 4 incompatibility)
   - Second attempt: Broke page layout despite webpack 5 compatibility
   - Reverted back to `^3.6.0` - functionality over vulnerability fixes

### ✅ Successfully Applied (continued):
4. **compression-webpack-plugin**: `^1.1.12` → `^11.1.0` ✅
   - Fixed serialize-javascript RCE vulnerability
   - Build and frontend working correctly
   - Vulnerabilities: 100 (reduced from 105)

---

## Next Steps (In Order):

### ✅ Successfully Applied (continued):
5. **node-fetch**: `^1.7.3` → `^3.3.2` ✅
   - Fixed SSRF vulnerability
   - Breaking: CommonJS → ESM migration handled gracefully
   - Vulnerabilities: 99 (reduced from 100)

### ✅ Successfully Applied (continued):
6. **webpack**: `^4.47.0` → `^5.100.2` ✅
   - Fixed braces ReDoS vulnerability
   - Major breaking change handled successfully
   - Vulnerabilities: 94 (reduced from 99)
   - Warnings: vega-lib named export warning, DefinePlugin NODE_ENV conflict

### ✅ Successfully Applied (continued):
7. **Babel 6 → 7** ✅
   - Fixed critical babel-traverse vulnerability

## Important Notes:

### Dockerfile Status:
- Currently using `npm install` instead of `npm ci` for testing
- Line 31: `RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps --ignore-scripts`
- Need to revert to `npm ci` after testing complete

### Docker Build Command:
```bash
cd /home/devreckas/Google-Drive/Work/matsen-lab/olmsted/olmsted
docker build -t olmsted:<test-name> .
```

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Interactive visualizations work
- [ ] Check npm audit for vulnerability count
