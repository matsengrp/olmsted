          helpText={<div>For a selected clonal family, its phylogenetic tree is visualized below the table in the 
          Clonal family details section. Select among any alternate phylogenies using the 
          Ancestral reconstruction method menu. Note that these ancestral reconstruction methods are according 
          to those specified in the input data according to the phylogenetic inference tool used to produce them - 
          Olmsted does not perform ancestral reconstruction (or any phylogenetic inference at all).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Alongside the tree is an alignment of the sequences at the tree's tips. Colors indicate amino acid mutations at each 
          position that differs from the sequence at the root of the tree (typically the family's inferred naive 
          antibody sequence). Scroll while hovering over the tree to zoom in and out. Click and drag the zoomed 
          view to pan in a traditional map-style interface. The alignment view on the right zooms in the vertical 
          dimension according to the zoom status of the tree. The tree's leaves use pie charts to show the 
          multiplicity (i.e. the number of downsampled and deduplicated sequences) represented by a given sequence, 
          colored according to sampling timepoint. See <a href="http://www.olmstedviz.org/schema.html">the schema</a> for 
          more detailed field descriptions. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Note that often in example data the number of sequences in a clonal family has been
          downsampled to build a tree (see downsampled_count, downsampling_strategy in <a href="http://www.olmstedviz.org/schema.html">the schema</a>),
          which explains why a clonal family might be listed in the table as having a few thousand unique sequences, but upon selecting 
          the clonal family, the corresponding tree visualization only contains 10s or 100s of sequences. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Use the interface below the tree to configure:
          <br/>
          <ul>
            <li>Maximum width of the tree window with respect to the alignment window (Tree width ratio)</li>
            <li>Field mapped to the size of pie charts at the tree' leaves (leaf_size_by)</li>
            <li>Maximum size of pie charts at the tree' leaves (max_leaf_size)</li>
            <li>Tree tip labels toggle on and off (show_labels)</li>
            <li>Fields mapped to branch width and color (branch_width_by, branch_color_by, branch_color_scheme, min_color_value)</li>
          </ul>
          In order to get more details about a particular lineage in the tree, click on a leaf's
          label (or on the dot at the center of the pie chart) - the Ancestral Sequences section will appear below the tree.
