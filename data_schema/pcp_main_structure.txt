PCP Main Data Structure
=======================
Based on: ford-flairr-seq-prod-UnmutInv_igh_pcp_2024-07-26.csv, example_pcp.csv

PCP (Parent-Child Pair) CSV Format
Row Structure (one row per parent-child relationship):
├── [index]: integer (row index, optional)
├── sample_id: string (sample identifier)
├── family: string|integer (family/clone identifier)
├── parent_name: string (parent node identifier)
├── parent_heavy: string (parent heavy chain sequence)
├── child_name: string (child node identifier)  
├── child_heavy: string (child heavy chain sequence)
├── branch_length: number (edge length between parent and child)
├── depth: integer (depth of child node in tree)
├── distance: number (cumulative distance from root to child)
├── v_gene_heavy: string (V gene assignment for heavy chain)
├── j_gene_heavy: string (J gene assignment for heavy chain)
├── cdr1_codon_start_heavy: integer (CDR1 region start position)
├── cdr1_codon_end_heavy: integer (CDR1 region end position)
├── cdr2_codon_start_heavy: integer (CDR2 region start position)  
├── cdr2_codon_end_heavy: integer (CDR2 region end position)
├── cdr3_codon_start_heavy: integer (CDR3 region start position)
├── cdr3_codon_end_heavy: integer (CDR3 region end position)
├── parent_is_naive: boolean (whether parent is naive/germline)
└── child_is_leaf: boolean (whether child is terminal node)

Simplified PCP Format (example_pcp.csv):
├── sample_id: string (sample/family identifier)
├── parent_name: string (parent node name)
├── child_name: string (child node name)
├── edge_length: number (branch length)
└── sample_count: integer (abundance/multiplicity)

Key Characteristics:
- Each row represents one parent-child relationship in a phylogenetic tree
- Multiple rows with same family ID represent the complete tree structure
- Sequences are typically full-length heavy chain nucleotide sequences
- CDR region annotations provide immunologically relevant boundaries
- Boolean flags indicate special node types (naive, leaf)

Data Relationships:
- sample_id groups rows belonging to same sample
- family groups rows belonging to same clone/phylogenetic tree
- parent_name/child_name define tree topology through relationships
- Naive nodes typically have parent_is_naive=True and serve as tree roots
- Leaf nodes have child_is_leaf=True and represent observed sequences

Tree Reconstruction:
- Tree topology inferred from parent-child pairs
- Root identified by naive nodes or nodes without parents
- Branch lengths provided directly (not cumulative)
- Tree can be reconstructed by linking parent_name → child_name relationships
