PCP Trees Data Structure
========================
Based on: example_trees.csv

PCP Trees CSV Format
Row Structure (one row per tree):
├── family_name: string (family/clone identifier matching PCP main data)
└── newick_tree: string (newick format phylogenetic tree)

Key Characteristics:
- Simple two-column format linking families to their tree representations
- family_name serves as foreign key to group related PCP parent-child pairs
- newick_tree provides complete tree topology with branch lengths
- Trees correspond to the reconstructed phylogeny from PCP parent-child relationships

Tree Format:
- Standard newick format: ((leaf1:0.008,leaf2:0.012)intermediate1:0.015)root:0.0;
- Node names match parent_name/child_name identifiers from PCP main data
- Branch lengths match branch_length values from PCP parent-child pairs
- Root node typically has length 0.0

Data Relationships:
- family_name links to 'family' field in PCP main data
- Node names in newick_tree correspond to parent_name/child_name in PCP pairs
- Branch lengths in tree should match branch_length values in PCP data
- Tree topology represents the complete phylogenetic structure

Usage:
- Provides pre-computed tree representation for visualization
- Alternative to reconstructing tree from parent-child pairs
- Enables direct tree processing and analysis
- Can be validated against PCP parent-child relationships

Examples:
family1 → ((leaf1:0.008,leaf2:0.012)intermediate1:0.015,(leaf3:0.010,leaf4:0.005)intermediate2:0.020)naive:0.0;
family2 → ((tip1:0.013,tip2:0.018)node1:0.025,(tip3:0.009,tip4:0.011)node2:0.022)root:0.0;
