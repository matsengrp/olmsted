## Opening (0:00-0:15)
**Visual**: Title card → Olmsted interface with scatterplot

Olmsted is a browser-based tool for interactive exploration and visualization of B cell receptor repertoire sequencing data and clonal lineage trees.

---

## Platform Overview (0:15-0:30)
**Visual**: Browser loading olmstedviz.org

The web application requires no installation and runs entirely in the browser. Data processing is performed client-side, with local IndexedDB persistence.

---

## Data Loading (0:30-0:45)
**Visual**: Drag and drop file into browser

Data files are loaded directly into the browser. Supported formats include AIRR-compliant JSON and PCP CSV, with conversion tools available for data preparation.

---

## Repertoire-Level View (0:45-1:00)
**Visual**: Scatterplot with clonal families

The scatterplot provides a repertoire-wide overview. Each point represents a clonal family. Axis mappings, color encoding, and faceting are configurable for exploratory analysis.

---

## Clonal Tree View (1:00-1:15)
**Visual**: Phylogenetic tree with alignment panel

Individual clonal families are displayed as phylogenetic trees with aligned sequences. Branch properties can be mapped to computed metrics including LBI, mutation count, or timepoint. Leaf nodes show multiplicity data.

---

## Lineage Detail View (1:15-1:30)
**Visual**: Click leaf node → ancestral sequence display

Selecting a sequence displays its full ancestral lineage from the germline sequence. Amino acid mutations are highlighted, enabling detailed analysis of somatic hypermutation patterns.

---

## Technical Features (1:30-1:45)
**Visual**: Multi-dataset interface with metrics

Additional features include multi-dataset comparison, computed phylogenetic metrics such as local branching index, and persistent client-side storage using IndexedDB.

---

## Access and Resources (1:45-2:00)
**Visual**: Website URL and GitHub displayed

Olmsted is available at olmstedviz.org. The tool is open source. Complete documentation and example datasets are available via GitHub.

---

## Closing (2:00-2:15)
**Visual**: Title card with institutional information

Olmsted: B cell lineage visualization. Developed by the Matsen Group at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.
